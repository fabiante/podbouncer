# podbouncer

Podbouncer is a [Kubernetes operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
responsible for deleting non-running pods after a configurable grace period.

## Description

Using podbouncer in your cluster will result in the deletion of all pods in one of
these states: `Pending`, `Completed`, `Failed`

This operator acts on pods of all namespaces, except the `kube-system` namespace.

This controller is fairly simple and has only one configuration option can configure
via a ConfigMap: The `maxPodAge` field controls the maximum age a non-running pod
may have before it will be deleted by this controller.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: config
  namespace: podbouncer-system
  labels:
    control-plane: controller-manager
    app.kubernetes.io/name: podbouncer
data:
  maxPodAge: "1h"
```

This ConfigMap is expected to be in the `podbouncer-system` namespace and named `podbouncer-config`.

You may use the `PODBOUNCER_CONFIG_MAP_FULL_NAME` env variable on the controller
pod to customize the namespace + name of the ConfigMap used by the controller.

*Keep in mind, that you must ensure the controller has the proper permission to access
the ConfigMap object for reading.*

```shell
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
# ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      # ...
      containers:
      - command:
        - /manager
        image: controller:latest
        name: manager
        # ...
        env:
          - name: PODBOUNCER_CONFIG_MAP_FULL_NAME
            value: podbouncer-system/podbouncer-config
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster

The operator is not yet build and release to any Image & Manifest registry, thus you
have to build and deploy it from source (this project).

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/podbouncer:latest
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

Since the controller does not use any custom resources, no CRDs have to be installed in your cluster.

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/podbouncer:latest
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Change controller configuration**
If you want to configure the controller, modify the ConfigMap in `config/samples/config.yaml`
and re-deploy the project

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/podbouncer:latest
```

### To Uninstall

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/podbouncer:latest
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/podbouncer/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

## Testing

### Create Test Pods

To test podbouncer, you must have some non-running pods in your cluster:

```shell
kubectl run --restart=Never --image busybox some-pod
kubectl run --restart=Never --image busybox some-other-pod
```
